# Decision-Tree-using-ID3-from-scratch

Decision tree implemented from sractch using the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithm. This algorithm uses Information Gain decide an attribute/feature to split the tree on. The purpose is to reduce the entropy / randomness in the dataset as the tree is created.

To print the structure of tree run print_tree

The image below shows how the tree was built for my data with the final label being assigned at the leaf node
